The project consists of an API directory which contain the backend services scripts, a React-web directory, which contains the reactjs application and a React Native directory which contains the react native application.

## The Backend API services
The backend API services follow the **RESTfull** approach. The services use **ExpressJS framework** along with **Sequelize** ORM. The APIs use **express-validator**, as middleware, for request validation and sanitization.
